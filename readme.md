# InlineDB
Welcome! Are you need of a portable database for your node application? Then InlineDB is for you. It is a small project I am trying to develop. This will enable you to create one or more lite databases that you can use in your application with no dependencies with an exception of node.js.

## Installation

As with all node packages,

`npm install inlinedb`
